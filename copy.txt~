It seems like every small town in Canada has its Hockey Heroes: The men and women who have made it big in Canada's Official Sport. 

These heroes might be local hockey players who have brought home the Stanley Cup or who have won Olympic Gold. They might also be coaches who have inspired us, the presenters who have entertained us, or people who have dedicated their lives to organizing leagues and teaching new players.

These people have left a lasting mark on our communities. Growing up, we heard their stories and read about their accomplishments on the walls and in the trophy cases of our local arenas. 

"Hockey Shrines" in Canada come in many forms: Plaques, billboards, signs on the highway, trophies, statues and even museum exhibits. 

They are very possibly a uniquely Canadian pheonominon, our way of commemorating the hockey heroes that we are the most proud of. These arefacts not only tell the history of our communities, but they also teach us about the importance of hockey to Canadian culture and identity.

Hockey Shrines is a community heritage mapping project, started by Lauren Archer, in an attempt to map and photograph these monuments, many of them from small rural towns spread all across the country. 

No matter the form, Hockey Shrines are important cultural heritage resource that remind us that all towns, no matter how small, have greatness in them.
